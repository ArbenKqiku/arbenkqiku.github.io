# Introduction
The analytics industry is obsessed with *data-driven decision-making*. On the first part, *data-driven*, we’ve done an outstanding job. We have powerful tools that let us measure almost every interaction users have with our websites and products.

But when it comes to the second part, *decision-making*, the industry seems stuck. We produce more data than ever, yet this abundance does not always translate into better decisions.

# What decisions are businesses actually interested in?
This may sound obvious, but it is worth stating explicitly. In analytics, we are often so focused on technical details that we lose sight of the business outcomes we are meant to support.

At its core, every business is trying to make a profit. Profit is the result of two levers: *revenue and cost*. If you help increase revenue or reduce costs, you are helping the business.

In practice, digital analysts are rarely exposed to the cost side of the equation. Most of the time, our work contributes to revenue: generating more leads in B2B contexts, or selling more products in e-commerce.

# What is a decision framework?

A decision framework is a way to structure choices so they can be discussed and evaluated deliberately. It makes choices *explicit* by clearly defining the alternatives under consideration. And it makes them *comparable* by evaluating those alternatives along a shared set of dimensions, so tradeoffs become visible.

Most business decisions can be seen as a tradeoff between two things: potential and efficiency.

Potential is about how big the opportunity is. It answers the question: if this worked well, how much impact could it have? In digital marketing, potential can be approximated by things like audience size or monthly search volume.

Efficiency is about execution quality. It describes how effectively that potential is turned into results. In digital marketing, this can be measured using metrics such as conversion rate, cost per lead, or return on ad spend.



# What is working and what isn't
The first step is understanding what is currently working and what is not. This is where analytics is strongest: describing performance across different parts of the business.

That assessment can be made across many dimensions. Which landing pages generate the most leads? Which product categories drive the most revenue? At which steps of the funnel do users drop off or get stuck?

# From performance to choices
Understanding what is working and what is not gives us a description of the current state. But decisions are not made by looking at isolated metrics. They are made by choosing between alternatives.

Most business decisions are not about fixing something that is clearly broken. They are about prioritizing between multiple reasonable options: which segment to focus on, which journey to optimize, which lever to pull first. In other words, decisions require comparison.

This is where decision frameworks come in. Their primary role is not to produce answers, but to make options comparable. By placing different choices on the same set of dimensions, frameworks force tradeoffs to become explicit. They create a common language for discussion.

Without this step, teams often talk past each other. One person argues from conversion rate, another from volume, another from effort or risk. Each argument can be correct on its own, yet still lead to stalemate. Comparability is what allows a decision to happen.

# Where do the choices come from?
An important clarification is that decision frameworks do not invent choices. The choices already exist, usually implicitly.

They come from the business: strategic goals, operational constraints, leadership concerns, or simple questions like “where should we focus next?” The analyst’s role is not to decide what the business should care about, but to take those options and structure them in a way that allows for deliberate decision-making.

That often means narrowing a broad problem space into a small set of meaningful alternatives, defining the dimensions along which those alternatives should be evaluated, and making the tradeoffs visible.

When done well, analytics stops being a reporting function and becomes a decision-support function. The conversation shifts from defending metrics to discussing priorities.
