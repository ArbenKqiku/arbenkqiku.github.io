# Introduction
This guide aims to achieve two goals: stream data in real-time from [UK's Companies House](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house) and integrate it with the entire dataset as new data becomes available over time. As companies' details change or new companies are created, this data reaches UK's Companies House streaming API and becomes available to end users. The UK Companies House is an executive agency of the UK Government, responsible for incorporating and dissolving limited companies, registering company information, and making this information available to the public. Here is a simplified architecture of the project:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-project-intro/image-11.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Here is the technical architecture:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-project-intro/basis.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Let's go through the different steps. This first task is actually being able to stream data from UK's Companies House API:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-project-intro/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Once we are able to do this, we need to create a Kafka cluster on Confluent to serve as the intermediary for the streaming data:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-project-intro/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Afterwards, we'll create a Kafka producer, a mechanism for streaming data to Kafka clusters:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-project-intro/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

All of the previous steps involve several scripts and multiple packages. To simplify the deployment and mitigate dependency issues we'll encapsulate all components into a Docker container. In this way, we'll to able to stream data to our Kafka cluster with one simple line of code, `docker start container_id`:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-project-intro/image-4.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Our Docker containers will be within a virtual machine, because we want to run them 24/7. If we run them locally, as soon as we shut down our computer, the containers will also stop:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-project-intro/image-5.png" alt="linearly separable data">

To manage the flow of data from Kafka and forward it to downstream processes, we'll use Mage as an orchestrator. To ensure continuous operation, Mage we'll also be encapsulated in a Docker container:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-project-intro/image-6.png" alt="linearly separable data">

In Mage, the initial block will retrieve data from the Kafka Cluster and pass it to a Python script:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-project-intro/image-7.png" alt="linearly separable data">

This script will conduct an initial cleanup of the data and then stream it in real-time to BigQuery:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-project-intro/image-8.png" alt="linearly separable data">

In BigQuery, initially we'll manually upload the entire dataset from the UK's Companies House into BigQuery. Afterwards, we'll utilize dbt (data build tool) to incrementally update the dataset with streaming data as it becomes available:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-project-intro/image-9.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Finally, we can visualize the data with our BI tool of preference. Note: data vizualization we'll not be covered in this guide.

# Set-up Google Platform, a Virtual Machine and Connect to it Remotely through Visual Studio Code
## Create a Google Cloud Project
The first thing that we have to do is to [create a GCP project](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en). In this project we'll host many of the things that we'll build, such as the application to produce streaming data, our orchestration tool, [Mage](https://www.mage.ai/), as well as our BigQuery database.

Once you reach the [Google Cloud Homepage](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en), click on *Console* on the top right corner.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/1-google-cloud/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

If you have never been a paying customer of Google Cloud, you should be able to enjoy a $300 free credit.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/1-google-cloud/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Once you are in the console, click on the top left, next to the Google Cloud logo.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/1-google-cloud/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Then, on the top right, click on *NEW PROJECT*

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/1-google-cloud/image-4.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Give your project a name and click on *CREATE*. I'll call mine <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">streaming-pipeline</span>:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/1-google-cloud/image-5.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Once your project has been created, click on *SELECT PROJECT*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/1-google-cloud/image-6.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, at the top left corner, you should see the name of your project:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/1-google-cloud/image-7.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, let's move to the next step, creating a virtual machine.

## Create a Virtual Machine

A virtual machine is essentially a computer within a computer. For instance, you can create a virtual machine on your local computer, completely separate from the physical hardware. In our case, we're opting to create a virtual machine in the cloud. Why? Because that's where our orchestrator, Mage, will reside. We need to host Mage on a machine that never shuts down to ensure the streaming pipeline can run continuously.

To create a virtual machine (VM), type <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">vm instances</span> in the search bar and click on *VM instances*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/2-virtual-machine-creation/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

This will take you to a screen where you'll see the option to enable the Compute Engine API. In Google Cloud, enabling specific services is akin to loading libraries in programming languages. In our case, we need the Compute Engine API to create and run a VM. Click on *ENABLE* to proceed:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/2-virtual-machine-creation/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Once the API has finished loading, click on *CREATE INSTANCE*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/2-virtual-machine-creation/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Give your VM a name and choose the region closest to you. Remember, we'll be creating other services later on. It's essential to maintain consistency in the region selection. Otherwise, when different services need to interact, they may encounter issues if their data is located in different regions.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/2-virtual-machine-creation/image-4.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Go to the <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Boot disk</span> section and click on *CHANGE*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/2-virtual-machine-creation/image-5.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Select the following options and click on *SELECT*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/2-virtual-machine-creation/image-6.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Under <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Firewall</span> select the following options. We need to enable these options otherwise we won't be able to access Mage from the outside world.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/2-virtual-machine-creation/image-7.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, click on *CREATE*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/2-virtual-machine-creation/image-8.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Once you VM is created, you can click on *SSH* to access it:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/2-virtual-machine-creation/image-9.png" alt="linearly separable data">

If everything works properly, you should see a screen similar to this:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/2-virtual-machine-creation/image-10.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Congratulations, you've successfully accessed your VM! However, working with the VM directly from the browser can be inconvenient, as it lacks the benefits of a modern IDE like Visual Studio Code. Therefore, we need to find a way to connect to our VM remotely. This is where SSH keys come in.

## Create SSH Keys and Access VM Remotely

SSH keys are a mechanism that allows you to securely connect to third-party applications. When you create SSH keys, you have two of them:

* A public SSH key, which you share with third-party applications - think of it as the lock
* A private SSH key, which you keep on your machine - think of it as the key

In essence, on your machine, you have the key to open the lock. When you open the lock, you access the third-party application. On a side note, I think that calling SSH keys both `keys` is a bit misleading. I would have personally called them `SSH key` and `SSH lock`. This would have made things easier to understand.

Anyway, go to your terminal, and type the following:

```bash
 ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/kafka-streaming -C arbenkqiku
```

In this case, <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">kafka-streaming</span> is the name that we give to our keys, and <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">arbenkqiku</span> is my username. If you don't know your username, simply type:

```bash
whoami
```

Add a password to your SSH keys. This is an additional security measure to prevent unwanted access.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/3-connect-to-vm-ssh-keys/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

This will create your SSH keys:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/3-connect-to-vm-ssh-keys/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

To locate your SSH keys, go to the following directory:

```bash
cd ~/.ssh/
```

If you type the following command, you'll see the content of your directory:

```bash
ls
```

You should be able to see the keys that we have just created. Please store them securily.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/3-connect-to-vm-ssh-keys/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, we need to take our public key, <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">the lock</span>, and add it to our VM.

Go to where your VM is located, and click on its name:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/3-connect-to-vm-ssh-keys/image-4.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Click on *EDIT*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/3-connect-to-vm-ssh-keys/image-5.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Go to the section called <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Security and access</span>, and click on *ADD ITEM*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/3-connect-to-vm-ssh-keys/image-6.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, go back to the terminal and type:

```bash
cat kafka-streaming.pub
```

This will display the content of your public key, your lock.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/3-connect-to-vm-ssh-keys/image-7.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Copy the content of your public key and add it to your VM:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/3-connect-to-vm-ssh-keys/image-8.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Click on *SAVE*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/3-connect-to-vm-ssh-keys/image-9.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, go back to where your VM is located and copy the External IP address. This basically represents the location of your VM.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/3-connect-to-vm-ssh-keys/image-10.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Go back to terminal and type:

```bash
ssh -i kafka-streaming arbenkqiku@34.65.113.154
```

Here is what the previous command means:

```bash
ssh -i name_of_private_key user_name@gcp_vm_instance_external_ip
```

With this command, we are basically saying: go to this external IP address, and use this private key to acces the VM. Once you run the command, it will ask you if you are sure you want to connect, type <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">yes</span>. You'll also be prompted to add the password that we added to the SSH keys when we created them.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/3-connect-to-vm-ssh-keys/image-11.png" alt="linearly separable data">

If everything worked correctly, you should be inside your VM:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/3-connect-to-vm-ssh-keys/image-12.png" alt="linearly separable data">

## Access VM Through Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Now that we know that we can access our VM remotely, let's do the same thing through VS code. Go to [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download VS code.

Then, go to extensions, look for <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">remote ssh</span> and install the "Remote - SSH" extension:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/4-vs-code-connection/image-1.jpeg" alt="linearly separable data">

In VS code, go to the the search bar and type <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">></span> and select the following option:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/4-vs-code-connection/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

If you already have an SSH config file, select it:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/4-vs-code-connection/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Then, type the following:

```yaml
Host kafka-streaming # Give a name to your host, this could be anything you want
  HostName 34.65.113.154 # Replace with the External IP address in GCP
  User arbenkqiku # Replace this with your user name
  IdentityFile /Users/arbenkqiku/.ssh/kafka-streaming # Location of your private SSH Key
```

Now, we still have to go back to the terminal one last time and type this:

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent)
ssh-add /Users/arbenkqiku/.ssh/kafka-streaming # Path to private SSH key
```

Then, type your password when prompted. This basically means that you can use your password when you try to access the VM through Visual Studio Code.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/4-vs-code-connection/image-4.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, go back to the search bar of Visual Studio Code, type <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">></span> and select the following option:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/4-vs-code-connection/image-5.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Among the options, you should see the host that you just created. Click on it:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/4-vs-code-connection/image-6.png" alt="linearly separable data">

This should open a new window and you should be prompted to add your password:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/4-vs-code-connection/image-7.png" alt="linearly separable data">

In the new window, click on this icon at the top right to open the terminal in VS code:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/4-vs-code-connection/image-8.png" alt="linearly separable data">

First of all, we can can see our user name followed by the name of the VM:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/4-vs-code-connection/image-9.png" alt="linearly separable data">

In addition, if we type:

```bash
uname -r
```

We can see that it is a GCP (Google Cloud Platform) machine.

Congrats! We connected to the VM remotely by using VS code.

# Stream from UK's Companies House API and Produce to Kafka

## Create a GitHub Repository

Let's create a GitHub repository where we'll store all of our code. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and click on *NEW*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/5-github-repo/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Give your repo a name, select the *Add a README file* checkbox and click on *Create repository*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/5-github-repo/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, click on *Code* and copy the URL of the repo:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/5-github-repo/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Go to the terminal of your VM in VS code and type:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ArbenKqiku/kafka-streaming-project.git
```

This will clone our project locally. Now, we can make changes locally and push them to our repository.

## Stream Data from UKâ€™s Companies House

The goal of this guide is to stream data in real time from [UK's Companies House](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house). The UK Companies House is an executive agency of the UK Government, responsible for incorporating and dissolving limited companies, registering company information, and making this information available to the public. Many services are available [digitally](https://idam-ui.company-information.service.gov.uk/), that means that you can register a company online or make modifications to a company you registered. These changes are then pushed through the [UK's Companies House Streaming API](https://developer-specs.company-information.service.gov.uk/streaming-api/reference/company-information/stream) and are available in real-time.

So, our goal right now will be to create a python script able to stream data in real time. Here the steps that we'll have to follow:
* [Register an account on the API](https://developer.company-information.service.gov.uk/)
* [Create an application](https://developer.company-information.service.gov.uk/manage-applications)

Once you have created the application, you can click on it:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Copy the API key and store it somewhere:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

In the terminal, create a directory named <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">streaming-pipeline</span> and access it.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now that you have created the directory, click on *Open...*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-9.png" alt="linearly separable data">

You should see that directory that we just created. Click on it:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-10.png" alt="linearly separable data">

You'll prompted to enter your password again. Now, let's install the python extention. This will make it easier to code later on. Go to Extensions and install the Python extension.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-14.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, we need to install <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">pip</span> in order to install python libraries. Go to the terminal and type the follwing command:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

The sudo apt update command is used on Debian-based Linux systems, such as Ubuntu, to update the package lists for repositories configured on the system.

Then type the following to install <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">pip</span>:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

If you type:

```bash
pip list
```

You should be able to see python packages installed by default:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-15.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Here is the list of packages that we'll have to install to complete the project. Copy them and save them into a file named <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">requirements.txt</span>

```

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-16.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Then, install all the packages with this command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This should start the installation:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-17.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, we need to test our API connection. Before testing it in the code, I usually prefer to test things in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). Postman is a platform that simplifies the process of working with APIs by providing a user-friendly interface for sending HTTP requests and viewing their responses. Go to the link previously provided and create an account:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-18.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Once you are in Postman, type <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">https://stream.companieshouse.gov.uk/companies</span> in the request field:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-19.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Go to *Authorization*, select *Basic Auth* and under *Username* paste your API key.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-20.png" alt="linearly separable data">

In theory, this should not work, but I could not find any alternatives. Usually, you simply add the API key at the end of the URL, similar to this:

```bash
https://stream.companieshouse.gov.uk/companies?api_key=12345
```
However, this was the only way to make it work. If everything worked correctly, the status of the request should indicate `200 OK` and you should some results:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-21.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Please note that the response may take some time. In my experience, it could take approximately 30 seconds. Occasionally, the cloud agent of Postman may not function properly when a request exceeds this duration. In such cases, you can try sending the request multiple times (I had to do it up to 3 times). Alternatively, consider downloading Postman Desktop, which has a higher tolerance for lengthier requests.

Postman makes it super easy to build your API requests. Once you have built a successful request, you can translate it to actual code in multiple programming languages. I love this feature of Postman. To see what our request looks in code, click on this icon at the top right:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-22.png" alt="linearly separable data">

You'll see that the Authorization header looks different than the API key. In reality, it is a Base64-encoded representation of the API.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-23.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, let's go back to the terminal in VS code. Click this icon to create a new file:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-12.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Name the file <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">company_house_stream.py</span> and click on enter:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-13.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Here is the code to create the API request:

```python
import requests
import json

# Define the base URL for the Companies House API
base_url = "https://stream.companieshouse.gov.uk/"

# Make a GET request to the 'companies' endpoint
response = requests.get(
    url=base_url + "companies",
    headers={
        "Authorization": 'Basic faefaefae==',
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate"
    },
    stream=True  # Stream the response data
)
```

First of all, we're importing the necessary packages. Then, we define the endpoint with the necessary headers, that we got from Postman. Even though my request is exactly the same as in Postman, for some reason it would not work. I later discovered that the issue is due to the <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">stream</span> argument. When accessing a streaming API, it is very important to specifiy this aspect. With code, our request is successful, however, it doesn't produce any output. We need to find a way to create an open connection, where results are streamed and displayed in real time.

Let's add this piece of code:

```python
# Stream data as it comes in
for line in response.iter_lines():
    # if there is data, decode it and convert it to json.
    if line:
        decoded_line = line.decode('utf-8')

        json_line = json.loads(decoded_line)

        #Â print streamed line
        print(json_line)
```

With this piece of code `for line in response.iter_lines():`, we iterate over each line of data received from the response object. iter_lines() is a method provided by the requests library to iterate over the response content line by line. With `if line:` we check for data. With `decoded_line = line.decode('utf-8')`, if there is data in the line, it is decoded from bytes to a string using UTF-8 encoding. The decode() method is used to decode byte sequences into strings. With `json_line = json.loads(decoded_line)`, once the line of data is decoded, it is assumed to be in JSON format, and the loads() method from the json module is used to parse the JSON data into a Python dictionary. Finally, it is printed. this is the final code:

```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://stream.companieshouse.gov.uk/"

response=requests.get(
    url=url+"companies",
    headers={
        "Authorization": 'Basic ZTA1YjQzYmYtNabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabc',
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate"
    },
    stream=True
)

print("Established connection to Company House UK streaming API")

for line in response.iter_lines():
    if line:
        decoded_line = line.decode('utf-8')

        json_line = json.loads(decoded_line)

        print(json_line)
```

If everything works correctly, you should have an open connection to the API and see continuosly streamed data:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-24.png" alt="linearly separable data">

However, let's try to make our code more resistant by handling exceptions:

```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://stream.companieshouse.gov.uk/"

try:
    response=requests.get(
        url=url+"companies",
        headers={
            "Authorization": 'Basic ZTA1YjQzabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabc',
            "Accept": "application/json",
            "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate"
        },
        stream=True
    )

    print("Established connection to Company House UK streaming API")

    for line in response.iter_lines():
        if line:
            decoded_line = line.decode('utf-8')

            json_line = json.loads(decoded_line)

            # Build empty JSON
            company_profile = {
                "company_name": None,
                "company_number": None,
                "company_status": None,
                "date_of_creation": None,
                "postal_code": None,
                "published_at": None
            }

            try:
                company_profile['company_name'] = json_line["data"]["company_name"]
            except KeyError:
                company_profile['company_name'] = "NA"

            try:
                company_profile['company_number'] = json_line["data"]["company_number"]
            except KeyError:
                company_profile['company_number'] = "NA"
            
            try:
                company_profile['company_status'] = json_line["data"]["company_status"]
            except KeyError:
                company_profile['company_status'] = "NA"

            try:
                company_profile["date_of_creation"] = json_line["data"]["date_of_creation"]
            except KeyError:
                company_profile["date_of_creation"] = "NA"

            try:
                company_profile["postal_code"] = json_line["data"]["registered_office_address"]["postal_code"]
            except KeyError:
                company_profile["postal_code"] = "NA"

            try:
                company_profile["published_at"] = json_line["event"]["published_at"]
            except KeyError:
                company_profile["published_at"] = "NA"

            print("")
            print("BREAK")
            print("")
            print(company_profile)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"an error occurred {e}")
```

Firstly, it's essential to handle exceptions that may occur when connecting to the API. Additionally, while the API provides a lot of columns for each row, I'm only interested in retrieving specific fields. To facilitate this, I've initialized an empty JSON placeholder:

```python
# Build an empty JSON placeholder
company_profile = {
    "company_name": None,
    "company_number": None,
    "company_status": None,
    "date_of_creation": None,
    "postal_code": None,
    "published_at": None
}
```

Then, I attempt to access the desired fields using try-except blocks:

```python
try:
    # Check if the key 'company_name' exists in json_line. If it does, assign its value to the 'company_name' key in the company_profile dictionary.
    company_profile['company_name'] = json_line["data"]["company_name"]
except KeyError:
    # If the key does not exist, assign "NA" to the 'company_name' key in the company_profile dictionary.
    company_profile['company_name'] = "NA"
```

As you can see, for each company data that we stream, we only keep the data we're interested:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/6-company-house-uk/image-25.png" alt="linearly separable data">

As the next step, we'll stream our data to Kafka!

## What is Kafka?

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a streaming platform that is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. In simple terms, think of Apache Kafka as a large messaging system that allows different applications to communicate with each other by sending and receiving streams of data in real-time. Apache Kafka was originally developed by engineers at LinkedIn. Kafka was initially conceived to address the challenges LinkedIn faced in handling real-time data streams, such as user activity tracking, operational metrics, and logging. In 2011, Kafka was open-sourced and became an Apache Software Foundation project.

In Kafka, there are essentially producers and consumers of data.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/7-what-is-kafka/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

However, the data is not directly shared from a producer to a consumer. The producer first sends the data to a topic, and then the consumer retrieves this data from the topic.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/7-what-is-kafka/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

In our project, there will only one consumer, but in reality, there could be multiple consumers retrieving data from a topic:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/7-what-is-kafka/image-4.png" alt="linearly separable data">

One of the strengths of Kafka is that each topic can have multiple copies, called partitions.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/7-what-is-kafka/image-5.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Think of a Kafka partition as a separate stack of ordered messages within a library. Each stack (partition) holds a series of messages related to a particular topic. This has many advantages:

1. **Parallel Work**: If multiple people want to read different books, they have to wait for their turn. Now, imagine if there are several stacks of books (partitions). Different people can read different books at the same time without waiting.

2. **Scalability**: Let's say the library gets more popular, and more books keep coming in. Instead of piling them all on one stack (partition), we create more stacks. This way, each stack can handle its own set of books without getting too crowded.

3. **Reliability**: What if one of the book stacks falls over or gets damaged? If all the books were in that one stack, it would be a problem. But since we have multiple stacks (partitions), if something happens to one, the others are still okay.

Kafka partitions are within a broker. A Kafka broker is a single server instance within the Kafka cluster. Brokers store and manage data (partitions) and handle requests from producers and consumers. Imagine a librarian at a specific desk in the library. Each librarian (broker) manages a set of books (partitions) and assists library visitors (producers and consumers).

A Kafka cluster is a collection of Kafka brokers that work together to handle and manage the flow of messages. Think of the Kafka cluster as a team of librarians working together in a large library.

## Create a Kafka Cluster

To send messages to Kafka, we first need to create a Kafka Cluster. To do that, we'll use [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io/). Confluent is a company founded by the creators of Apache Kafka. Confluent abstracts the complexities of managing Kafka clusters, similar to how Google Cloud abstracts the underlying server infrastructure for cloud-based services.

We're all set, we can now start producing data to our Kafka topic!

## Produce Simulated Data to a Kafka Topic

I have taken part the following guide from [Confluent's documentation](https://developer.confluent.io/get-started/python/#configuration). In the VM, copy and paste the following configuration data into a file named `getting_started.ini`, substituting the API key and secret that you just created for the `sasl.username` and `sasl.password` values, respectively.

```yaml
[default]
bootstrap.servers={{ kafka.broker.server }}
security.protocol=SASL_SSL
sasl.mechanisms=PLAIN
sasl.username=< CLUSTER API KEY >
sasl.password=< CLUSTER API SECRET >

[consumer]
group.id=python_example_group_1

# 'auto.offset.reset=earliest' to start reading from the beginning of
# the topic if no committed offsets exist.
auto.offset.reset=earliest
```

To find your bootstrap server, go under *Cluster Settings*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/9-produce-data-kafka/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Here is what it should look like:

```yaml
[default]
bootstrap.servers=pkc-lzoyy.europe-west6.abcabcabcabcabc
security.protocol=SASL_SSL
sasl.mechanisms=PLAIN
sasl.username=GGPabcabcabcabcabc
sasl.password=/rmTFMqsvD4/CEs7tJEZAD6/NV9OOabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabc

[consumer]
group.id=python_example_group_1

# 'auto.offset.reset=earliest' to start reading from the beginning of
# the topic if no committed offsets exist.
auto.offset.reset=earliest
```

Now, create a file named `producer.py` and paste the following:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
from random import choice
from argparse import ArgumentParser, FileType
from configparser import ConfigParser
from confluent_kafka import Producer

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Parse the command line.
    parser = ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('config_file', type=FileType('r'))
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Parse the configuration.
    # See https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md
    config_parser = ConfigParser()
    config_parser.read_file(args.config_file)
    config = dict(config_parser['default'])

    # Create Producer instance
    producer = Producer(config)

    # Optional per-message delivery callback (triggered by poll() or flush())
    # when a message has been successfully delivered or permanently
    # failed delivery (after retries).
    def delivery_callback(err, msg):
        if err:
            print('ERROR: Message failed delivery: {}'.format(err))
        else:
            print("Produced event to topic {topic}: key = {key:12} value = {value:12}".format(
                topic=msg.topic(), key=msg.key().decode('utf-8'), value=msg.value().decode('utf-8')))

    # Produce data by selecting random values from these lists.
    topic = "purchases"
    user_ids = ['eabara', 'jsmith', 'sgarcia', 'jbernard', 'htanaka', 'awalther']
    products = ['book', 'alarm clock', 't-shirts', 'gift card', 'batteries']

    count = 0
    for _ in range(10):

        user_id = choice(user_ids)
        product = choice(products)
        producer.produce(topic, product, user_id, callback=delivery_callback)
        count += 1

    # Block until the messages are sent.
    producer.poll(10000)
    producer.flush()
```

Let's go through the code together. This line `#!/usr/bin/env python` tells the terminal that the script should be executed with a python interpreter. The next piece of code parses an argument from the command line. Later, when we'll run this script, we'll execute it with `./producer.py getting_started.ini`. `getting_started.ini` represents the command-line argument that we're parsing.

```python
# Parse the command line.
parser = ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('config_file', type=FileType('r'))
args = parser.parse_args()
```

Here, we're are creating a <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Kafka Producer</span> based on our configuration file `getting_started.ini`. 

```python
# Parse the configuration.
# See https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md
config_parser = ConfigParser()
config_parser.read_file(args.config_file)
config = dict(config_parser['default'])

# Create Producer instance
producer = Producer(config)
```

Here, we define the topic where we'll produce the data. I named my topic <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">company_house</span>, so, I'll change the name from <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">purchases</span> to <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">company_house</span> in the `producer.py` file. `user_id` and `products` are simply fake data that we'll produce to our topic as an exercise. 

```python
# Produce data by selecting random values from these lists.
topic = "purchases"
user_ids = ['eabara', 'jsmith', 'sgarcia', 'jbernard', 'htanaka', 'awalther']
products = ['book', 'alarm clock', 't-shirts', 'gift card', 'batteries']
```

Here, we are producing the data to the topic:

```python
count = 0
for _ in range(10):

    user_id = choice(user_ids)
    product = choice(products)
    producer.produce(topic, product, user_id, callback=delivery_callback)
    count += 1

# Block until the messages are sent.
producer.poll(10000)
producer.flush()
```

If you go to the terminal, and if you type `python3 producer.py getting_started.ini`, you should see this as the output:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/9-produce-data-kafka/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Then, go to the Confluent console, click on *Topics* and then on your topic name, in my case <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">company_house</span>:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/9-produce-data-kafka/image-4.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Click on *Messages*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/9-produce-data-kafka/image-5.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Below, you should see the messages that we just produced to the topic:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/9-produce-data-kafka/image-6.png" alt="linearly separable data">

This is awesome! 

## Produce UK's Companies House Data to a Kafka Topic

So far, we were able to do 2 things:
* Stream data continuously from UK's Companies House API
* Produce simulated data to our Kafka topic

Now, to integrate these 2 scripts, we need to stream data from UK's Companies House API and produce it (send it) to our Kafka topic.

Create a file named `producer_company_house.py` and paste the following code:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
from random import choice
import json
import requests
from argparse import ArgumentParser, FileType
from configparser import ConfigParser
from confluent_kafka import Producer

if __name__ == '__main__':

    url = "https://stream.companieshouse.gov.uk/"

    # Parse the command line.
    parser = ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('config_file', type=FileType('r'))
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Parse the configuration.
    config_parser = ConfigParser()
    config_parser.read_file(args.config_file)
    config = dict(config_parser['default'])

    # Set idempotence configuration
    config['enable.idempotence'] = 'true'

    # Create Producer instance
    producer = Producer(config)

    try:
        response=requests.get(
            url=url+"companies",
            headers={
                "Authorization": 'Basic ZTA1YjQzYmYtNDY4OC00YWFjLWIxZWItOTY2MWUxYzZjMDA0Og==',
                "Accept": "application/json",
                "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate"
            },
            stream=True
        )

        print("Established connection to Company House UK streaming API")

        for line in response.iter_lines():
            if line:
                decoded_line = line.decode('utf-8')

                json_line = json.loads(decoded_line)

                # Build empty JSON
                company_profile = {
                    "company_name": None,
                    "company_number": None,
                    "company_status": None,
                    "date_of_creation": None,
                    "postal_code": None,
                    "published_at": None
                }

                try:
                    company_profile['company_name'] = json_line["data"]["company_name"]
                except KeyError:
                    company_profile['company_name'] = "NA"

                try:
                    company_profile['company_number'] = json_line["data"]["company_number"]
                except KeyError:
                    company_profile['company_number'] = "NA"
                
                try:
                    company_profile['company_status'] = json_line["data"]["company_status"]
                except KeyError:
                    company_profile['company_status'] = "NA"

                try:
                    company_profile["date_of_creation"] = json_line["data"]["date_of_creation"]
                except KeyError:
                    company_profile["date_of_creation"] = "NA"

                try:
                    company_profile["postal_code"] = json_line["data"]["registered_office_address"]["postal_code"]
                except KeyError:
                    company_profile["postal_code"] = "NA"

                try:
                    company_profile["published_at"] = json_line["event"]["published_at"]
                except KeyError:
                    company_profile["published_at"] = "NA"

                # Produce data to Kafka topics
                topics = {
                    "company_house": company_profile,
                }

                # Optional per-message delivery callback
                def delivery_callback(err, msg):
                    if err:
                        print('ERROR: Message failed delivery: {}'.format(err))
                    else:
                        print("Produced event to topic {}: key = {} value = {}".format(
                            msg.topic(), msg.key(), msg.value()))

                # Produce data to Kafka topics
                for topic, message in topics.items():
                    producer.produce(topic, key=message["company_number"].encode('utf-8'), value=json.dumps(message).encode('utf-8'), callback=delivery_callback)

                # Block until the messages are sent.

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"an error occurred {e}")
```

Let's go through the major changes. Here, we define the topic and the content of a specific message with `company_profile`.

```python
# Produce data to Kafka topics
topics = {
    "company_house": company_profile,
}
```

Here is what the following code does. It iterates through each topic and message pair in the `topics` dictionary, extracts the `company_number` from the message, encodes the `company_number` and the JSON-formatted message content to UTF-8 encoding using .encode('utf-8') and produces the encoded key-value pair to the Kafka topic using `producer.produce()`.

```python
# Produce data to Kafka topics
for topic, message in topics.items():
    producer.produce(topic, key=message["company_number"].encode('utf-8'), value=json.dumps(message).encode('utf-8'), callback=delivery_callback)
```

If you type the following code in your terminal `python3 producer_company_house.py getting_started.ini`, it should stream data from UK's Companies House and produce it to the Kafka topic <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">company_house</span>. If you go on the Confluent console, you should see incoming messages:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/10-company-house-kafka/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

As a next step, we'll containerize our application.

# Containerize our Application
## Create a Docker Container of Our Application

A Docker container is a small box that holds everything your application needs to run, like its code, libraries, and settings. This box is like a mini-computer that you can easily move around. Docker containers work similarly. They bundle up all the software and dependencies your application needs into a single package, making it easy to run your application on any computer that has Docker installed. This is very useful because regardless of where you run your container, it will always run consistently. On the other hand, if you share your code with someone else, maybe they don't have the necessary dependencies to run your code.

To create a Docker container, you need a Docker image, and to create a Docker image, you need a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is like a recipe, that **shows** all the ingredients and steps necessary to prepare a meal. A Docker image is analogous to **having** the necessary ingredients and appliances ready to cook the meal. It's a snapshot of a filesystem and its configuration that forms the basis of a container. A Docker container is like the **actual** prepared meal. It's a running instance of a Docker image, containing everything needed to run the application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/11-create-containerized-app/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

So, this is what our Dockerfile looks like. Create a new file named `Dockerfile` and paste the following content. Docker automatically recognizes the file named `Dockerfile`:

```yaml
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.10

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements_docker.txt

# Make the script executable
RUN chmod +x producer_company_house.py

# Run the script with the provided configuration file as an argument
CMD ["./producer_company_house.py", "getting_started.ini"]
```

Here is what each line means. Here, we are basically taking an existing Docker image and building on top of it. It would be like buying the pre-made dough and then add your toppings to prepare your pizza.

```yaml
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.10
```

Here, we are setting the working directory in the container. It like running `cd` from the command-line.

```yaml
# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app
```

Here, we are copying the entire content of the current directory, the directory where your Docker image will be created, and paste all the contents.

```yaml
# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app
```

Here, we install the necessary python packages.

```yaml
# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements_docker.txt
```

Please, create a file named `requirements_docker.txt` and paste the following content. We are doing this because to produce data to our Kafka topic we don't need all the packages in the file `requirements.txt`.

```
configparser==6.0.1
confluent-kafka==2.3.0
requests==2.31.0
```

This line makes the file `producer_company_house.py` executable. Making a file executable is necessary to allow it to be run as a program or script. When a file is marked as executable, it means that the operating system recognizes it as a program or script that can be executed directly. Without executable permissions, attempting to run the file will result in a permission denied error.

```yaml
# Make the script executable
RUN chmod +x producer_company_house.py
```

Finally, we run the script `producer_company_house.py` with the config file `getting_started.ini` as a command-line argument.

```yaml
# Run the script with the provided configuration file as an argument
CMD ["./producer_company_house.py", "getting_started.ini"]
```

To create our Docker image from our Dockerfile, we first need to install docker. Letâ€™s download a GitHub repo that contains the installation for Docker:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MichaelShoemaker/DockerComposeInstall.git
```

Letâ€™s access the folder that contains the Docker installation:

```bash
cd DockerComposeInstall
```

Letâ€™s modify the file to make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x InstallDocker
```

Then, letâ€™s run it:

```bash
./InstallDocker
```

Type this to verify that Docker has been installed correctly:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This should show the following message:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/11-create-containerized-app/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Before proceeding, ,ake sure you saved all the files mentioned in the Dockerfile. If you made any modifications to a file without saving it, the modifications will not be included in the Dockerfile. 

Now, go back to the folder that contains your Dockerfile and type the following. This basically instructs the system to build a docker image called <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">kafka producer</span> from our Dockerfile. The dot indicates the Dockerfile.

```bash
docker build -t kafka-producer .
```

This should build your Docker image:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/11-create-containerized-app/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

If you type `docker images`, you should see the Docker image we just built:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/11-create-containerized-app/image-4.png" alt="linearly separable data">

To run a container instance of the Docker image, type:

```bash
docker run kafka-producer
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/14-install-mage/image-11.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, if you go to Confluent, you'll see that we're actually producing data to the <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">company_house</span> topic:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/11-create-containerized-app/image-5.png" alt="linearly separable data">

If you go under messages, you should see new incoming messages:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/11-create-containerized-app/image-6.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Here a couple of nifty tricks related to Docker. To see the Docker containers that are currently running, type:

```bash
docker ps
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/14-install-mage/image-9.png" alt="linearly separable data">

To see all Docker containers, type:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/14-install-mage/image-10.png" alt="linearly separable data">

To stop a running Docker container, type:

```bash
docker stop container_id
```

For example:

```bash
docker stop a2cd18c97c49
```

To see restart a Docker container, type:

```bash
docker start container_id
```

To remove a Docker container, first, you need to stop it, then type:

```bash
docker rm container_id
```

To see all Docker images available, type:

```bash
docker images
```

Now that we know that we can produce data to Kafka, you can stop your Docker container.

So far, we've developed a Kafka producer to stream data from the UK's Companies House API to a Kafka topic. This functionality is packaged into a Docker image, from which we've launched a Docker container. I would say that this is quite an achievement, congrats!

Up until now, we produced data to a Kafka topic. Right now, we'll consume data by using Mage, a data orchestrator.

# From Kafka to BigQuery through Mage
## Install Mage
A data orchestrator allows to build ETL (extract, transform and load) data pipelines. That means extracting data from one or multiple systems, apply some transformations to it, and then export it in another system, such as a data warehouse. Mage is a modern and very user-friendly orchestrator.

[Here](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-zoomcamp) is the repo for the installation guide, but we'll go through the installation here as well.

You can start by cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-zoomcamp.git mage-zoomcamp
```

Navigate to the repo:

```bash
cd mage-zoomcamp
```

Rename `dev.env` to simply `.env` â€” this will ensure the file is not committed to Git by accident, since it will contain credentials in the future.

Now, let's build the container:

```bash
docker compose build
```

Finally, start the Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Then, go to ports in your VM, and click on the browser icon:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/14-install-mage/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

If everything worked correctly, you should be able to access Mage:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/14-install-mage/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

However, right now we're accessing Mage from the our localhost. It would be great to access it via our external IP address.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/14-install-mage/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

The external IP address allows users outside the VM's network to interact with Mage. This can be useful for remote access, enabling team members or clients to use Mage without needing direct access to the VM.

Type <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">firewall</span> in the search bar and click on *Firewall*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/14-install-mage/image-4.png" alt="linearly separable data">

At the top, click on *CREATE FIREWALL RULE*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/14-install-mage/image-5.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Give a name to your firewall rule, then select the following options and click on *CREATE*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/14-install-mage/image-6.png" alt="linearly separable data">

With this, we're basically allowing ingress traffic through port 6789, which is where Mage is located. Then, go back to your VM, copy your external IP address and type it followed by `:6789`. This is what it looks like in my case:

```bash
34.65.113.154:6789
```

Now, you should be able to access Mage via the external IP address:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/14-install-mage/image-7.png" alt="linearly separable data">

## Consume Data from Kafka Topic

Let's create a new pipeline. At the top left, click on *New* and then on *Streaming*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/15-consume-mage-kafka/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Give a name to your streaming pipeline and click on *Create*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/15-consume-mage-kafka/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

In Mage, a pipeline is composed of blocks. The different blocks are `Data loader`, `Transformer` and `Data exporter`. Your pipeline can have as many blocks as you want. As we need to consume the data from the Kafka topic, click on *Data loader* and select *Kafka*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/15-consume-mage-kafka/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Give a name to your block and click on *Save and add*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/15-consume-mage-kafka/image-4.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Similar to what we did in the file `getting_started.ini`, we need to define the configuration with the:
* bootstrap server
* topic
* username
* password

Here is what it should look like:

```yaml
connector_type: kafka
bootstrap_server: "pkc-lzoyblablablablaluent.cloud:9092"
topic: company_house
consumer_group: unique_consumer_group
include_metadata: false
api_version: 0.10.2

# Uncomment the config below to use SASL_SSL config
security_protocol: "SASL_SSL"
sasl_config:
    mechanism: "PLAIN"
    username: GGPabcabcaabcabca
    password: /rmTFMqsvD4/CEs7tJEZAD6/NV9Oabcabcaabcabcaabcabcaabcabcaabcabca
```

In a streaming pipeline using Kafka, it is not possible to consume data with a simple Data loader block, we also need to add a Transformer block. Click on *Transformer* > *Python* > *Generic (no template)*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/15-consume-mage-kafka/image-5.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Give a name to your block and click on *Save and add*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/15-consume-mage-kafka/image-6.png" alt="linearly separable data">

One of the coolest things on Mage is that you can visually see how the elements of your pipeline interact with each other:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/15-consume-mage-kafka/image-9.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Also, with simple drag and drop you change how the various blocks interact with each other.

Anyway, now, we are ready to consume data. However, we are currently not producing any. We can simply start the Docker container that we created previously. So, let's see what is the container id of my Docker container:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/15-consume-mage-kafka/image-7.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Therefore, I'll type:

```bash
docker start 3d7a82c606d4
```

Soon enough, on Confluent you should see that you are producing data:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/15-consume-mage-kafka/image-8.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, go back on Mage and click on *Execute pipeline*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/15-consume-mage-kafka/image-10.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Soon enough, you should see that we're consuming messages from Kafka:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/15-consume-mage-kafka/image-11.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Congrats! As a next step, we'll send the streamed data to BigQuery.

## Send Streamed Data to BigQuery

Now, let's send the data that we're streaming to BigQuery. To do that, we first need to create a data set in BigQuery. In BigQuery, a data set is the equivalent of a database in other systems. So, type <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">big query</span> and click on *BigQuery*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

If you havent' done it already, enable the BigQuery API:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

The basic structure of BigQuery is *Project* > *Dataset* > *Tables*. In our case, we first have to create a dataset. Click on the three dots next to your project name and click on *Create dataset*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Give a name to your dataset, select a region and click on *CREATE DATASET*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-4.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, let's create a service account. A service account is essentially an account authorized to make changes on your behalf. This is particularly useful in scenarios where browser authentication is not feasible, such as in a production environment. Type <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">service accounts</span> in the search bar and click on *Service Accounts*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-5.png" alt="linearly separable data">

On the top left, click on *CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-6.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Give a name to your service account and click on *CREATE AND CONTINUE*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-7.png" alt="linearly separable data">

This service account will only interact with BigQuery, so I only gave it `BigQuery Admin` permissions. If you want your service account to interact with other resources, you should extend your permissions. Click on *CONTINUE*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-8.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Finally, click on *DONE*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-9.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Click on the service account that you just created:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-10.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Go to *KEYS*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-11.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Click on *ADD KEY*, and then *Create new key*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-12.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Select *JSON* and click on *CREATE*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-13.png" alt="linearly separable data">

This will download the credentials of your service account that we'll use to make changes on BigQuery when in a non-interactive environement. To add the credentials to your VM, drag them to this area:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-14.png" alt="linearly separable data">

One of the worst mistakes you could make is to inadvertently publish your credentials on a GitHub repository. To prevent this, we can create a file named `.gitignore`. Any content listed in this file will be ignored by GitHub, ensuring it's not published in the current repository. Since our credentials are stored in `.json` format, to prevent them from being added to our GitHub repository, simply add the following line to your `.gitignore` file:

```bash
# Ignore files with .json extension
*.json
```

Currently, we've only created a dataset in BigQuery. To begin streaming data, we need to create a table. So, let's start by pushing some mock streaming data to a new table. Open a new python file and paste this code:

```python
import io
import json
import pandas as pd
import pyarrow.parquet as pq
from google.cloud import bigquery # pip install google-cloud-bigquery and pyarrow as a dependency
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    '/home/arbenkqiku/streaming-pipeline/streaming-pipeline-418713-7f7d915b1fc7.json', scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'],
)

client = bigquery.Client(project=credentials.project_id, credentials=credentials)

job_config = bigquery.LoadJobConfig()

json_example = {'company_name': 'CONSULTANCY, PROJECT AND INTERIM MANAGEMENT SERVICES LTD', 'company_number': '13255037', 'company_status': 'active', 'date_of_creation': '2021-03-09', 'postal_code': 'PE6 0RP', 'published_at': '2024-03-23T18:37:03'}
df = pd.DataFrame([json_example])

df['date_of_creation'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_of_creation'])
df['published_at'] = pd.to_datetime(df['published_at'])

table_name = 'company_house_stream'

table_id = '{0}.{1}.{2}'.format(credentials.project_id, "company_house", table_name)
job_config.write_disposition = bigquery.WriteDisposition.WRITE_APPEND

# Upload new set incrementally:
# ! This method requires pyarrow to be installed:
job = client.load_table_from_dataframe(
    df, table_id, job_config=job_config
)
```

The following piece of code loads service account credentials from a JSON key file located at `/home/arbenkqiku/streaming-pipeline/streaming-pipeline-418713-7f7d915b1fc7.json`. These credentials are used to authenticate with Google Cloud services, specifically BigQuery.

```python
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    '/home/arbenkqiku/streaming-pipeline/streaming-pipeline-418713-7f7d915b1fc7.json', scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'],
)
```

The next code snippet initializes a BigQuery client using the obtained credentials and specifies the project ID associated with those credentials and creates a BigQuery load job configuration (job_config):

```python
client = bigquery.Client(project=credentials.project_id, credentials=credentials)
job_config = bigquery.LoadJobConfig()
```

This creates a DataFrame (df) containing a single example record (json_example) representing data to be loaded into BigQuery. This record includes fields like 'company_name', 'company_number', 'company_status', etc. It then converts date fields ('date_of_creation' and 'published_at') in the DataFrame to datetime objects using pd.to_datetime() to ensure compatibility with BigQuery's date format.

```python
json_example = {'company_name': 'CONSULTANCY, PROJECT AND INTERIM MANAGEMENT SERVICES LTD', 'company_number': '13255037', 'company_status': 'active', 'date_of_creation': '2021-03-09', 'postal_code': 'PE6 0RP', 'published_at': '2024-03-23T18:37:03'}
df = pd.DataFrame([json_example])

df['date_of_creation'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_of_creation'])
df['published_at'] = pd.to_datetime(df['published_at'])
```

Here we define the destination table ID (table_id) where the DataFrame data will be loaded. This table is located in the `company_house` dataset within the specified project.

```python
table_name = 'company_house_stream'
table_id = '{0}.{1}.{2}'.format(credentials.project_id, "company_house", table_name)
```

This configures the job to append the DataFrame data to the existing table if it already exists (job_config.write_disposition = bigquery.WriteDisposition.WRITE_APPEND).

```python
job_config.write_disposition = bigquery.WriteDisposition.WRITE_APPEND
```

Finally, this initiates a BigQuery load job (job) to upload the DataFrame data to the specified table.

```python
# Upload new set incrementally:
# ! This method requires pyarrow to be installed:
job = client.load_table_from_dataframe(
    df, table_id, job_config=job_config
)
```

If you now go on BigQuery, you should see a table named <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">company_house_stream</span>. If you click on *PREVIEW*, you should see the mock-up data that we sent.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-15.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, let's got back on Mage to the transfomer block, remove the existing code and add this code:

```python
from typing import Dict, List
import pandas as pd
import pyarrow as pa
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.oauth2 import service_account

if 'transformer' not in globals():
    from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import transformer

@transformer
def transform(messages: List[Dict], *args, **kwargs):

    #Â define container for incoming messages
    incoming_messages = []

    counter = 1
    for msg in messages:

        counter += 1

        # append each message

    # turn into a pandas data frame
    df = pd.DataFrame(incoming_messages)

    # convert string columns to date or date time
    df['date_of_creation'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_of_creation'])
    df['published_at'] = pd.to_datetime(df['published_at'])

    # define credentials
    credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
        '/home/src/streaming-pipeline-418713-7f7d915b1fc7.json', scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'],
    )

    #Â define client
    client = bigquery.Client(project=credentials.project_id, credentials=credentials)

    # define job
    job_config = bigquery.LoadJobConfig()

    # define table name and big query details
    table_name = 'company_house_stream'
    table_id = '{0}.{1}.{2}'.format(credentials.project_id, "company_house", table_name)
    job_config.write_disposition = bigquery.WriteDisposition.WRITE_APPEND

    print("BLOCK 3.1")

    print(df)

    # Upload new set incrementally:
    # ! This method requires pyarrow to be installed:
    job = client.load_table_from_dataframe(
        df, table_id, job_config=job_config
    )

    print(df.head())

    return df
```

Let's analyze this code. Here we iterate over each message in the messages list and append it to a new list called incoming_messages. This is essentially collecting all the incoming messages into a single list.

```python
#Â define container for incoming messages
incoming_messages = []

counter = 1
for msg in messages:
    # print(counter)
    counter += 1
    # print(msg)

    # append each message
    incoming_messages.append(msg)
```

This converts the list of dictionaries (incoming_messages) into a Pandas DataFrame (df).

```python
    # turn into a pandas data frame
    df = pd.DataFrame(incoming_messages)
```

The rest of the code is basically the same as the previous script. The only thing that really changes is the location of our credentials:

```python
# define credentials
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    '/home/src/streaming-pipeline-418713-7f7d915b1fc7.json', scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'],
)
```

Since we're within Mage, the location needs to be in Mage. One of the cool features of Mage is that you can access its internal terminal, and see what files are available and what are the respective paths:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-16.png" alt="linearly separable data">

First of all, as you can see the default path in Mage starts with `/home/src`. However, when I type `ls` the credentials are nowhere to be seen:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-17.png" alt="linearly separable data">

This is because we actually need to drag our credentials into the Mage folder:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-18.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Once we do that, we see that the credentials are available:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-19.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now we are able to test the pipeline! Go back to the terminal and start the Docker container that produces data to the Kafka topic. Once you see incoming data on Confluent, go to Mage and click on *Execute pipeline*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-20.png" alt="linearly separable data">

On Mage, you should see the data that we're consuming:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-21.png" alt="linearly separable data">

On BigQuery, you should see the number of rows gradually increasing:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-22.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Here is approximately 1 minute later:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/16-streamed-data-to-big-query/image-23.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Congrats! We just built a working streaming pipeline, that:
* Streams data from UK's Companies House API
* Produces it to a Kafka topic
* Consumes it from a Kafka topic
* And finally streams it to a BigQuery table

## Create Table that Contains all UK's Companies House Data

For now, let's stop our Docker container that produces data for the Kafka topic and cancel our pipeline on Mage. Next, we need to create a BigQuery table containing all the available data from the UK's Companies House up to March 2024. I downloaded the data from [here](https://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_output.html) and cleaned it up. You can find the cleaned data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive); please download it. In the next step, as we stream incoming data, we'll merge it with this table containg all the available data.

Here is the script to send the overall table of UK's Companies House data to BigQuery. Given the size of the table, namely 437 MB, I was not able to run the script in my VM so I had to run it locally, which took almost 15 minutes. Anyway, this does not have any incidence on our project as in the end everything will run programmatically in the cloud.

```python
import io
import json
import pandas as pd
import pyarrow.parquet as pq
from google.cloud import bigquery # pip install google-cloud-bigquery and pyarrow as a dependency
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    '/home/arbenkqiku/streaming-pipeline/mage-zoomcamp/streaming-pipeline-418713-7f7d915b1fc7.json', scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'],
)

df = pd.read_csv("company_house_core_clean.csv")

client = bigquery.Client(project=credentials.project_id, credentials=credentials)

job_config = bigquery.LoadJobConfig()

table_name = 'company_house_core'

table_id = '{0}.{1}.{2}'.format(credentials.project_id, "company_house", table_name)
job_config.write_disposition = bigquery.WriteDisposition.WRITE_APPEND

# Upload new set incrementally:
# ! This method requires pyarrow to be installed:
job = client.load_table_from_dataframe(
    df, table_id, job_config=job_config
)
```

These are the only two aspects that differ from the previous script. First of all, we read a csv of the clean data. Then, the table name changes.

```python
df = pd.read_csv("company_house_core_clean.csv")

table_name = 'company_house_core'
```

The columns `date_of_creation` and `month_of_creation` should be of type `DATE`:

# Apply Transformations with dbt (data build tool)

## How to Set-Up dbt
dbt, also known as the Data Build Tool, is designed for data transformation tasks. It enables the creation of reusable modules, which are essentially blocks of SQL code that can be consistently applied across different scenarios. For example, you can ensure that a KPI is calculated in a standardized manner by utilizing the same dbt module across various contexts. Additionally, dbt introduces programming language features such as functions and variables into SQL workflows, expanding the capabilities beyond traditional SQL. Furthermore, dbt offers version control, a feature typically absent in SQL environments, allowing for better management and tracking of changes to data transformations.

In our case, we'll use dbt to create the following workflow:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/17-dbt-installation/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

* (1) As new data is streamed in, we capture a snapshot of the latest information, which includes all data accumulated since the previous snapshot was taken.
* (2) From this data, we extract the most recent timestamp available. This timestamp will be helpful for retrieving the next snapshot.
* (3) Subsequently, we utilize the snapshot to update the overall UK's Companies House data.
* This process repeats as we capture another snapshot of the most recent streamed data, using the last timestamp from the previous snapshot.

This process enables continuous updates to the UK's Companies House data as new data is streamed.

In theory, now you could safely delete your development branch. However, in our case we have just started, so we won't delete it yet.

## Create dbt Data Sources

First of all, let's create a new folder for our staging models and data sources. We'll use this while we develop our models. Once we're satisfied, we can move them into production. Click on the three dots next to the `models` folder, and click on *Create folder*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Call your folder <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">staging</span> and click on *Create*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Within the `staging` folder, click on *Create file*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Click on *Save as* at the top right:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-4.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Name your file <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">schema.yml</span> and click on *Create*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-5.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Paste the following code:

```yaml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: staging
    database: streaming-pipeline-418713 # BigQuery project id
    schema: company_house # BigQuery data set
    tables:
      - name: company_house_core
      - name: company_house_stream
```

In this configuration:

* `version: 2`: Specifies the version of the YAML configuration file.
* `sources`: Defines the data sources used in the project.
* `name`: staging: Provides a name for the data source.
* `database`: streaming-pipeline-418713: Specifies the BigQuery project ID where the data resides.
* `schema`: company_house: Indicates the BigQuery dataset containing the tables.
* `tables`: Lists the tables within the specified dataset.
* `name`: company_house_core: Names one of the tables within the dataset.
* `name`: company_house_stream: Names another table within the dataset.

This configuration allows dbt to locate and access the specified data in BigQuery. It is essentially a representation of the data that we have in BigQuery:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-6.png" alt="linearly separable data">

## Create dbt Models

Now, let's build our first model. Here we have an issue of the chicken of and the egg. We need to create a snapshot of the most recent data, but we don't have any timestamp. So, let's create a timestamp first.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-8.png" alt="linearly separable data">

In the `staging` folder, create a file named `get_last_timestamp.sql` and paste the following code. Unfortunately, for some reason my site was not able to parse jinja code, so, I'll simply paste here an image of the code. In any case, you can find the code in my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ArbenKqiku/streaming-pipeline/tree/main/models/staging)

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-repair/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

This code snippet is written in Jinja templating language. This is used by dbt for managing and transforming data in data warehouses.

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

The config part is a Jinja directive used to configure settings for the dbt model. In this case, it sets the materialization method for the dbt model to 'table', indicating that the results of the SQL query will be stored in a table.

`select published_at from {{ source('staging', 'company_house_stream')}} order by published_at limit 1`: This is a SQL query written inside the Jinja template. It selects the `published_at` column from the `company_house_stream` table in the `staging` schema. The `{{ source(...) }}` syntax is a Jinja function call that dynamically generates the name of the table based on the provided arguments.

In this query, we're selecting the 1st timestamp, as it is the 1st time that we are retrieving the streamed data. However, later we'll modify this query with:

```sql
order by
    published_at desc
limit
    1
```

As we want the most recent timestamp. Once you have created your model, click on *Save* at the top right:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-9.png" alt="linearly separable data">

At the bottom, if you click on *Compile*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-10.png" alt="linearly separable data">

You can see what the code looks like in actual SQL:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-11.png" alt="linearly separable data">

If you click on *Preview*, you can see what the actual result would be:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-12.png" alt="linearly separable data">

If you click on *Build*, it would build your model, which means that a table named `get_last_timestamp` will be created:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-13.png" alt="linearly separable data">

If you click at the bottom left corner:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-14.png" alt="linearly separable data">

You can see the details that went into building your model:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-15.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, on BigQuery you should see a new dataset called `dbt_` followed by your username, in addition to the table `get_last_timestamp`:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-16.png" alt="linearly separable data">

The dataset has this name because we're still in a development environement. Later, when we'll push our dbt models to production, a new dataset called `prod` will be created.

While developing, given that we'll integrate the newly streamed data into the complete UK's Companies House data, and given that our models will be pushed to the `dbt_arbenkqiku` dataset, we need to have the complete UK's Companies House data in our development dataset as well. Create a new dbt model called `company_house_core.sql` and paste the following code:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-repair/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Save the model and click on *Build*. In BigQuery, next to the development dataset, click on the three dots and then click on *Refresh contents*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-17.png" alt="linearly separable data">

You should see a replica of the complete UK's Companies House data:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-18.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now that we have a new dataset with two tables, we can add them to our configuration file `schema.yml`. We can call these sources `development`:

```
version: 2

sources:
  - name: staging
    database: streaming-pipeline-418713 # BigQuery project id
    schema: company_house # BigQuery data set
    tables:
      - name: company_house_core
      - name: company_house_stream
  - name: development
    database: streaming-pipeline-418713 # BigQuery project id
    schema: dbt_arbenkqiku # BigQuery data set
    tables:
      - name: company_house_core
      - name: get_last_timestamp
```

Now, create a new dbt model named `snapshot_streamed_data.sql` and paste the following code:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-repair/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

In this code, by using the timestamp that we retrieved earlier, we only get the data that is newer then the last timestamp. This is reflected in the condition `stream.published_at > last_timestamp.published_at`. This ensures that we create a snapshot of the most recent data. Also, here I purposely modify the company status with `concat("test_", current_timestamp()) as company_status`. This is because later we will merge the snapshot of the streamed data with the main table, and I want to ensure that the data in the main table is properly updated. Of course, later we'll use the actual `company_status`. Save your dbt model and build it.

If everything worked correctly, you should see a new table named `snapshot_streamed_data`:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-19.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Also, let's add this new table to our configuration file by adding this line:

```yaml
- name: snapshot_streamed_data
```

Now, let's integrate the streamed data in the complete UK's Companies House data. To do so, we need to replace the content of the dbt model called `company_house_core.sql` with the following code. This is because we want to update the BigQuery table called `company_house_core`:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-repair/image-4.png" alt="linearly separable data">

The following code snippet implements an incremental materialization strategy, which means updating the table instead of recreating it. Specifically, it updates rows based on a unique identifier called `company_number`. The model compares existing data with incoming data for each `company_number` and updates rows if there are any differences.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-repair/image-5.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Here we create a common table expression (CTE) named `ranked_data`. We do this because we want to able to filter out duplicate rows. In this line of code specifically `row_number() over (partition by company_number order by published_at desc) as row_num`, with this window function we group data by company number, order it by the column `published_at` in descending order, and count the row numbers.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-repair/image-6.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Finally, with the condition `row_num = 1`, we only select the most recent instance for each `company_number`.

```
select
    company_name,
    company_number,
    company_status,
    date_of_creation,
    postal_code,
    month_of_creation,
from
    ranked_data
where
    row_num = 1
```

Now, we need to verify that the data has been updated correctly in the `company_house_core` table.  If we run this query in BigQuery, where we're essentially extracting the rows from the `company_house_core` table that match a `company_number` contained in the table `snapshot_streamed_data`:

```sql
select
  *
from
  `streaming-pipeline-418713.dbt_arbenkqiku.company_house_core`
where
  company_number in 
    (
    select
      distinct company_number
    from
      `streaming-pipeline-418713.dbt_arbenkqiku.snapshot_streamed_data`
    )
```

We can see that the column `company_status` matches the artifically created column:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/18-dbt-data-sources/image-20.png" alt="linearly separable data">

## Test the Entire Pipeline in a Development Environment

First of all, in the dbt model `get_last_timestamp.sql`, replace `order by published_at` with `order by published_at desc`, as we want to get the last timestamp. Also, replace the source as we want to get the last timestamp from the most recent snapshot. This is what the final code looks like:

Save the dbt model and click on *Build*. Now, if you check the timestamp in the table `get_last_timestamp`, you should have the most recent timestamp available from the table `snapshot_streamed_data`:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/19-dbt-development-test/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, go to the terminal and start the Docker container that produces data to the Kafka topic. When you see production data in the Confluent console, start the Mage streaming pipeline as well. After a couple of minutes, stop these 2 process as we have generated enough new data to test things in our dbt development environment.

In dbt, build (run) the model `snapshot_streamed_data.sql`. If you then go to BigQuery, you should see that the table `snapshot_streamed_data` only contains the most recent streamed data.

Finally, we can build model `company_house_core.sql`. If we extract the unique `company_number` values from the `company_house_core` table, we can see that the data has been updated successfully:

Right now, we are on the development branch of our GitHub repo. To use our dbt models in production, we need to make a pull request to our main branch, and then merge the dev branch with the main branch, as we did at the beginning of the dbt section:

## Test the Pipeline in Production

In dbt production, a new dataset named `prod` will be created. However, the entire UK's Companies House data does not exist in this dataset. So, in the dbt model `company_house_core.sql` replace the content with this code:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-repair/image-8.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Save the model and push it to production. Now, from the dbt menu, click on *Deploy* and then on *Jobs*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Click on *Create job* and then on *Deploy job*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Give a name to your job, add the command `dbt build --select company_house_core`, which essentially replicates the entire UK's Companies House data, and click on *Save* at the top right:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Then, go back to that job and click on *Run now* at the top right:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-4.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Below, at the run history, you can see the current. Click on it:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-5.png" alt="linearly separable data">

If everything worked correctly, all the steps should be green:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-6.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Also, in BigQuery you should see a new dataset named `prod` with the same tables as previously:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-7.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, given that our production dataset is called `prod`, in our configuration environment we need to replace the dataset from `dbt_arbenkqiku` to `prod`. Also, I replaced the name of the data sources from `development` to `production`:

```
version: 2

sources:
  - name: staging
    database: streaming-pipeline-418713 # BigQuery project id
    schema: company_house # BigQuery data set
    tables:
      - name: company_house_core
      - name: company_house_stream
  - name: production
    database: streaming-pipeline-418713 # BigQuery project id
    schema: prod # BigQuery data set
    tables:
      - name: company_house_core
      - name: get_last_timestamp
      - name: snapshot_streamed_data
```

`development` should be replaced with `production` in all the models. Also, in the model `company_house_core.sql` we can replace the code that replicates the entire UK's Companies House data with the code that merges the most recent streamed data:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/22-repair/image-9.png" alt="linearly separable data">

As before, `commit and sync` your changes, `create a pull request on GitHub` and merge the branches. Remember, if your models are not in the main branch they won't run in production.

Now, go back to *Jobs*, and create a job for each model:

* `snapshot_streamed_data`
* `company_house_core_prod`. This was already created.
* `get_last_timestamp`

Here is what the job <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Snapshot streamed data</span> looks like:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-8.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Here is what the job <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Get last timestamp</span> looks like:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-9.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, as before, go to the terminal and start the Docker container that produces data to the Kafka topic. When you see production data in the Confluent console, start the Mage streaming pipeline as well. After a couple of minutes, stop these 2 process as we have generated enough new data to test things in our dbt development environment.

Now, let's run our jobs in the following order:
* <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Snapshot streamed data</span> 
* <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Core Prod</span>
* <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Get last timestamp</span>

Select the job <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Snapshot streamed data</span>. Click on *Run now*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-10.png" alt="linearly separable data">

There should be a new snapshot of data:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-11.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, select the job * <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Core Prod</span>. Click on *Run now*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-12.png" alt="linearly separable data">

We can see that the data was successfully integrated in the entire UK's Companies House data:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-13.png" alt="linearly separable data">

If we retrieve the most recent timestamp from the `snapshot_streamed_data` table, we get this

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-14.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now, let's run the <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Get last timestamp</span> job and see if we get the same result:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-15.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Aaaaaaand it matches:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/20-dbt-production/image-16.png" alt="linearly separable data">

## Schedule and Run the Entire Pipeline

Previously, we ran our jobs in the following order:

* <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Snapshot streamed data</span> 
* <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Core Prod</span>
* <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Get last timestamp</span>

Now, we need to schedule them. The job <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Snapshot streamed data</span>, needs to be run separately from the other jobs. This is because we must ensure that the snapshot data remains static and does not change.

Go to the <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Snapshot streamed data</span> job and click on *Settings*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/21-schedule/image-1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Click on *Edit*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/21-schedule/image-2.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Scroll down, toggle *Run on schedule*, select *Cron schedule* and the following *Custom cron schedule*:

```
0,20,40 * * * *
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/21-schedule/image-3.png" alt="linearly separable data">

This means that this job will always run at minute 0, 20, and 40 of every hour, every day. Save the job.

Create a new job named <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">Core Prod & Get last timestamp</span> with the following commands:

```bash
dbt build --select company_house_core
dbt build --select get_last_timestamp
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/21-schedule/image-4.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Add the following cron schedule:

```
10,30,50 * * * *
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/21-schedule/image-5.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Save the job. On dbt, the maximum frequency for a job is every 10 minutes. Therefore, to test whether everything runs smoothly, we have to patient.

Now, as before, go to the terminal and start the Docker container that produces data to the Kafka topic. When you see production data in the Confluent console, go to Mage and click on *Triggers*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/21-schedule/image-6.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Click on *New trigger*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/21-schedule/image-7.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Give a name to the trigger, click on *Schedule* and then on *Save*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/21-schedule/image-8.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Now click on *Enable trigger*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/21-schedule/image-9.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Our pipeline is now running, it consumes data from Kafka and sends it to BigQuery:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/21-schedule/image-10.png" alt="linearly separable data">

On Confluent, we can see that we're both producing and consuming 64 bytes per second:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/21-schedule/image-11.png" alt="linearly separable data">

So, I let the entire pipeline run for a couple of hours and no issues were detected. The newly streamed data was successfully integrated into the entire UK's Companies House data:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/article-4-kafka-streaming/21-schedule/image-12.png" alt="linearly separable data">

If you recall, in the model `snapshot_streamed_data.sql`, the column company status was defined as `concat("test_", current_timestamp()) as company_status`. This was done for testing purposes. Now that we know that everything runs smoothly, we can replace it with simply `company_status`.
