I started my career as a digital marketer, but gradually I gravitated more towards the world of data. Currently, I work as a digital analyst, which is great as I can use my domain knowledge as a digital marketer as well as sharpen my data skills. Here are the tools that I use most for my day to day job:

* Data collection: Google Tag Manager, GA4, BigQuery, Javascript
* Data orchestration: Docker, Mage, dbt, GCP
* Data cleaning: R, SQL, Python
* Data analysis: R, SQL, Python, Excel
* Data vizualization: ggplot2, Looker Studio

Thw world of data is very complex, and I occasionally write guides as I learn along. I have had the honor of being featured on Simo Ahava's blog two times:

* [Join Google Ads and GA4 data in BigQuery](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/join-ga4-google-ads-data-in-google-bigquery/)
* [Content Analysis with GA4, BigQuery, R, Sheets, and Looker Studio](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/content-analysis-using-ga4-bigquery-r-google-sheets-data-studio/)

I used to work for a digital marketing agency called [comtogether](https://www.comtogether.com/), and I have written several articles while I was there. Here are some of them:
* [Building a data-driven channel attribution model using Markov chains](https://www.comtogether.com/2020/07/13/building-a-data-driven-channel-attribution-model-using-markov-chains/)
* [Optimise and detox your YouTube Ad campaigns using n-gram analysis](https://www.comtogether.com/2021/02/17/optimise-and-detox-your-youtube-ad-campaigns-using-n-gram-analysis/)
* [How to triple your return on ad spend using predictive modelling](https://www.comtogether.com/2022/02/15/how-to-triple-your-return-on-ad-spend-using-predictive-modelling/)

The other articles that I have written can be found on my website. I also share some of my work on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arben-kqiku-301457117/). If you work in a related field or enjoy my work, don't hesitate to connect!

Happy coding and happy learning :)
