I am a digital marketer, data scientist and polyglot.

I help our clients achieve their goals through digital marketing. Here is what I do:

* Develop custom digital marketing strategies (Which channels? Which messages? Which ad formats? Which tactics? Which audiences?)
* Implement digital marketing campaigns by using various channels (SEA, Display, Shopping, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn), in 4 languages (English, German, French & Italian) and by using several ad formats (dynamic ads, lead ads, collections, videos, etc.).
* Optimize campaigns and provide feedback through interactive dashboards and custom reports.

I also regularly use data science to:

* Answer complex business questions (who are our digital business personas? What is the influence of the weather on our sales?)
* Automate repetitive tasks that save a lot of time
* Develop tools that improve the bottom line of our clients (ex.: bid manager that adjusts bids depending on weather conditions).
